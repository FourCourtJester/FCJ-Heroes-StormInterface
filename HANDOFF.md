# FCJH — Handoff

Custom `.StormInterface` observer overlay for Heroes of the Storm, for esports/broadcast use.
Written for whoever picks this up next, human or model.

## 1. Where things stand

**Fresh start, 2026-09-25.** The first attempt (builds 1–50) proved nearly every technique
we need but drifted, because no one had drawn the target screen. It is archived, not lost:
build 50 lives in git history and as the validator's test fixture
(`tests/fixtures/build50/`). Everything it taught is in §3 and §6.

**The design is agreed** and lives in a canvas of to-scale wireframes:
**https://claude.ai/artifact/6MmAcxcKjfAAprCN3oc3ZK** — the stock UI annotated, the
proposed default view at 1920×1080, and a spec table giving each element's position and
how sure we are the game allows it. **Every build is checked against it.**

In one paragraph: the ten hero cells sit along the bottom (blue 1–5 left of the minimap,
red 6–0 right of it) with portrait, HP, mana and CC; the minimap and its objective widgets
at bottom-centre; team core HP above the cells; a two-line top bar of series score, team
name, logo and level either side of Blizzard's hexagon, with bans, bracket and game count
beneath; the kill feed top-right; replay controls top-left, collapsible; info panes
(talents, KDA/damage, healing, siege) at middle-left on hotkeys; talent pop-ups on the
cells. **Fight mode is not a separate layout** — it is one hotkey that hides a list of
elements (list TBD, info pane first). The top bar and minimap always stay.

**Branding is negative space**: names, logos, scores, bans, bracket and game count are
drawn by OBS over empty regions the interface leaves (§6).

**Phase 0 (foundation) is done**: the toolchain, `layout.toml`, generated layouts,
dev/release profiles, and an in-game wireframe overlay. The source holds no overlay
elements yet. Next is Phase 1 (§7).

---

## 2. The loop

```
python tools/pack.py --wait
```

One command: **generate → stage → validate → pack → deploy.**

1. **generate** — `tools/gen.py` rewrites the committed generated layouts from `layout.toml`
2. **stage** — `src/FCJH.StormInterface/` is copied to `build/<profile>/`. A dev build adds
   the build stamp and the wireframe overlay there, and only there
3. **validate** — `tools/validate.py` on the staged tree; an error stops the build
4. **pack** — an uncompressed MPQ v1 archive, read back and compared file by file
5. **deploy** — `Documents/Heroes of the Storm/Interfaces/FCJH.StormInterface`

**With the client left open** (all confirmed 2026-09-25):

1. Launch Heroes **from the Battle.net app**. Double-clicking a replay goes through
   `HeroesSwitcher`, which has no auth token — that is the password prompt that never remembers.
2. Open a **current-patch** replay from the in-game Replays tab (§5).
3. Edit, then `python tools/pack.py --wait`.
4. Leave the replay. The file is **locked while a replay is open** and writable at the main
   menu; `--wait` retries, so the build lands the moment you exit.
5. Reopen the replay. **The game re-reads the interface on every replay load.**

**Profiles.** Dev (the default) shows a build stamp — `FCJH DEV <version> <commit>[+] <time>`,
`+` meaning uncommitted changes — and tints every wireframe box on screen in its legend
colour (white: ours, orange: OBS space, teal: on demand), so each element can be built
against where it is meant to land. `--release` is exactly what `src/` holds: it refuses
while `src/`, `layout.toml` or `tools/` have uncommitted changes, so every release is
reproducible from its commit, and writes `dist/v<version>/FCJH.StormInterface`
(`--deploy` to also install it). GitHub releases ship that file.

### Tools

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `python tools/pack.py --wait` | The loop above |
| `python tools/gen.py [--check]` | Regenerate; `--check` fails if a generated file is stale or hand-edited |
| `python tools/validate.py [--show <frame path>]` | Validate `src/`; `--show` prints the merged tree under any frame |
| `python tools/test_validate.py` | 19 validator tests against the build 50 fixture |
| `python tools/mpq.py list\|extract <archive>` | Inspect any archive, including Ahli's and Spazzo's |
| `python tools/make_test_ui.py` | Smoke test: a magenta box as `FCJHTest.StormInterface`, to tell "packer broke" from "layout broke" |

**The validator** rebuilds the GameUI frame tree the way the game does — Blizzard's layouts
from the JamiePhan extract in DescIndex order, templates expanded, `file=` overrides applied
— and checks what our files contribute. Errors: unparseable XML (the game silently drops the
*whole* interface), undefined constants, missing templates or override targets, frame
references that resolve to nothing, malformed anchors, and edits to Blizzard children that
don't exist (the game silently creates an empty frame). Warnings: parking a frame others
anchor to, anchoring a side Blizzard re-anchors at runtime, `Visible=false` on Blizzard
frames, `Fill` without `AdjustmentColor`, partial constants, type mismatches. The Java
builder it replaced checked far less — its anchor validator was `TODO` stubs.

---

## 3. Authoring

**The user never touches XML.** Their surfaces are `layout.toml`, the wireframe canvas, and
the game. Describe effects, not diffs; verify with screenshots.

```
layout.toml                                  every placement number, in wireframe PIXELS
tools/gen.py                                 turns it into layouts
src/FCJH.StormInterface/                     the archive's file tree, one to one
  Base.StormData/UI/Layout/
    DescIndex.StormLayout                    GENERATED — every layout, constants first
    FCJH_Constants.StormLayout               GENERATED — layout.toml in layout units
    FCJH_*.StormLayout                       hand-written, one per concern (from Phase 2)
```

- **Layout units are not pixels.** The game lays out on a 1200-unit-tall grid, so at 1080p
  **1 unit = 0.9 px** on both axes (the screen is 2133 × 1200 units). Build 50 proved it:
  slots set 102 units apart measured ~92 px. `layout.toml` holds pixels straight off the
  wireframe; `gen.py` converts. Never hand-convert.
- Every element becomes constants `FCJH_<NAME>_L/_T/_R/_B/_W/_H`, edges measured from the
  screen's top-left — anchor them to `$GameUI` with `pos="Min"`. Hero cells are
  `FCJH_HERO_1` … `FCJH_HERO_0`.
- **Generated files are committed** and carry a do-not-edit header; `gen.py --check` catches
  hand edits. Hand-written XML for one-off structure (it maps one to one onto Blizzard's and
  Ahli's files); Python generation for anything arithmetic or repetitive.
- **Frames we add carry the `FCJH_` prefix.** The validator relies on it: an unprefixed child
  that doesn't exist in Blizzard's tree is an error, because the game would silently create
  an empty frame. Constants are global across all files, so ours are `FCJH_` too.
- Split layouts by concern, not one file.

### Rules learned the hard way (all confirmed in game)

- **Park, don't hide.** `Visible=false` does not stick on Blizzard panels; move the frame
  off-screen, pinning all four anchors.
- **Parking a frame drags anything anchored TO it.** `HeroPortraitImage` anchors to
  `IconFrame`; parking `IconFrame` sent all ten portraits off-screen for three builds. Hide
  such frames with `Alpha 0`. (The validator now warns.)
- **Render order follows the frame TREE; `RenderPriority` only sorts siblings.** Frames added
  to `GameUI` paint above everything in `UIContainer`. To sit behind a Blizzard frame, inject
  beside it inside its own hierarchy.
- **The base UI binds no player to the hero cells** — the engine fills them by ordinal
  position. Addressing heroes by `PlayerId` is a different axis. Inherit, never rebuild (§6).
- **Blizzard StateGroups can `SetAnchor` at runtime**, overriding our anchors (e.g.
  `HeroDeathTimeLabel`). The validator warns.
- **`#Constant` substitutes only as a whole attribute value.** `Fill` reads `AdjustmentColor`
  (`A,R,G,B`), not `Color`.
- **`ObserverTopPanel` is load-bearing for the portraits** — park only its art.
- **Duplicate frame names are everywhere** (`PartyFramePanel` has its own `Team1HeroOverview`).
  Confirm ownership by displacing a frame, not by matching a name.

### Practices

- **Keep the build stamp.** A stale stamp means a cached interface; nothing else on screen is
  evidence.
- **Displace, don't guess.** After two unexplained builds, move each suspect somewhere obvious.
- **Colour a frame garishly before concluding it doesn't render.**
- **One change per build.** Stacked unverified builds produce an unattributable mess.
- **`python tools/validate.py --show <path>`** before guessing what a frame is anchored to.

## 4. Reference material

- **`references/JamiePhan/`** — shallow clone of
  [jamiephan/HeroesOfTheStorm_Gamedata](https://github.com/jamiephan/HeroesOfTheStorm_Gamedata),
  an automated extract of Heroes game data, currently **2.55.17.97650**. The validator's
  source of truth. Refresh with `git -C references/JamiePhan pull --depth 1`.
- **`references/Galaxy-Observer-UI-HeroesFix/`** — Spazzo's fork of Ahli's (retired) builder.
  Its `tools/plugins/mpq/MPQEditor.exe` is an independent check of our archives
  (`MPQEditor.exe e <mpq> * <dest> /fp`).
- **`references/AhliObs.StormInterface/`, `references/Spazzo/`** — two mature observer
  interfaces, unpacked. Ahli's is MIT. Most techniques here came from reading them.

`references/` is gitignored. Key base-UI files, under
`references/JamiePhan/mods/core.stormmod/base.stormdata/ui/layout/ui/`:

| File | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `gameui.stormlayout` | The root frame tree and most handles |
| `stormobserverpanel.stormlayout` | Observer top bar, hero cells, team containers, core HP, levels |
| `partyframe.stormlayout` | Player HUD top bar — has `TeamTalentAdvantageFrame`, the talent-lead flame (line 3268) |
| `unitstatus.stormlayout` | World nameplates, CC validators, buff/debuff element |
| `heroconsole.stormlayout` | Bottom-left portrait/stats cluster |
| `talentsoverviewpanel.stormlayout` | Talent tier grid |

## 5. Environment gotchas

**Interface selection lives in TWO files**: `Documents/Heroes of the Storm/Variables.txt` and
`.../Accounts/<id>/Variables.txt`, keys `observerinterface=` and `replayinterface=`, full
filename with extension. Edit only while Heroes is closed — it rewrites both on exit (it
blanked the top-level keys and kept the account file's on 2026-09-25). Set both.

**Out-of-patch replays wipe the selection** via a client version switch — five times so far.
Keep a current-patch replay; an AI-vs-AI custom lobby you observe produces one.

**File lock**: the selected interface is locked while a replay (presumably a match) is open.

**Resolution is locked to 1920×1080** in the top-level `Variables.txt` (backup
`Variables.txt.res-bak`). `layout.toml` assumes it.

**Screenshots** land in `Documents/Heroes of the Storm/Screenshots/` and can be read directly.
Ask for one rather than a description.

---

## 6. Design decisions worth not relitigating

**Relocate Blizzard's hero cells; don't rebuild them.** No bindable "icon for this player's
hero" exists; relocated cells bring portraits, HP, click handling and death state, and
survive new heroes. Spazzo's per-hero textures are why his files run to 13,000 lines.

**Inherit bindings; never reconstruct them.** Put new frames *inside* the frame that owns the
binding — the CC sensor lives inside each cell's `HeroStatus`, so it always matches the
portrait above it. The mana bar should follow the same pattern.

**Use Blizzard's CC plate, not a rebuilt one.** A hand-built label rendered nothing; the
engine's element is self-managing.

**Branding is negative space**, drawn by OBS. The interface can't see OBS, so there is no
in-game fallback for missing names or logos.

**Don't resize the portraits.** The 165-unit frame and its texture coordinates are chosen
together; anything matching the visible slot anchors to the cell.

**Fight mode = a hotkey that hides a list, not a layout.** The agreed default view already
is the old fight-mode cluster. Pooled team HP is dropped: layouts have no arithmetic, and
five segments would duplicate the hero row. If plates read too small, widen them.

---

## 7. What's next

**Phase 1 — the unknowns, before building anything they could change.** One sitting in a
replay; each is a small dev build.

- **Calibration:** does the wireframe overlay land where the canvas says? (Confirms the
  0.9 px/unit conversion on screen.)
- **Minimap:** does it fit each map's shape, and can a layout tell which map is loaded?
- **Talent-lead flame:** `TeamTalentAdvantageFrame` lives in the *player* HUD — does the
  engine drive it while observing?
- **Mana bar** inside each cell's `HeroStatus`, for mana, energy, fury and brew heroes.
- **Hide-hotkey** mechanism. Known pattern: `ToggleControl + Shortcut → StateGroup →
  SendEvent → Animation`; a StateGroup's single active state gives the brief's exclusivity.
- **Talent pop-ups:** read how Ahli wires his first (no launch needed).
- **Info pane:** can Blizzard's 1035-wide talent table be re-laid out with teams stacked?

**Phase 2 — build the default view one element at a time**, each checked by screenshot
against the canvas: hero row → minimap → top bar → info pane → kill feed → replay tab →
pop-ups → fight hotkey.

**Carried over from build 50, to solve again in Phase 2:** its health bars were cut into short
slanted segments — prime suspect `HeroStatus`'s `ImageMaskFrame` (`AlphaMaskTexture
@UI/obs_bar_player_blue`, drawn for a 134 px bar, `stormobserverpanel.stormlayout:270`); and
its CC text sat half behind the bar row.

## 8. Original brief

`~/Downloads/hots-observer-interface-brief.md`, outside the repo. The operating model is a
**solo observer/commentator** who also talks: anything mid-fight is one keypress, and the
default view must look right untouched. Since tested: the top bar *can* be displaced, and
per-hero CC for non-selected heroes *is* readable.
