# FCJH — Handoff

Custom `.StormInterface` observer overlay for Heroes of the Storm, for esports/broadcast use.
Written for whoever picks this up next, human or model.

## 1. Where things stand

**Fresh start, 2026-09-25.** The first attempt (builds 1–50) proved nearly every technique
we need but drifted, because no one had drawn the target screen. It is archived, not lost:
build 50 lives in git history and as the validator's test fixture
(`tests/fixtures/build50/`). Everything it taught is in §3 and §6.

**The design is agreed** and lives in a canvas of to-scale wireframes:
**https://claude.ai/artifact/6MmAcxcKjfAAprCN3oc3ZK** — the stock UI annotated, the
proposed default view at 1920×1080, and a spec table giving each element's position and
how sure we are the game allows it. **Every build is checked against it.**

In one paragraph: the ten hero cells sit along the bottom (blue 1–5 left of the minimap,
red 6–0 right of it) with portrait, HP, mana and CC; the minimap and its objective widgets
at bottom-centre; team core HP above the cells; a two-line top bar of series score, team
name, logo and level either side of Blizzard's hexagon, with bans, bracket and game count
beneath; the kill feed top-right; replay controls top-left, collapsible; info panes
(talents, KDA/damage, healing, siege) at middle-left on hotkeys; talent pop-ups on the
cells, and a green-plus pop-up on any hero below 25% health (drawn under the talent
pop-up). **Fight mode is not a separate layout** — it is one hotkey that hides a list of
elements (so far: the info pane and the health markers). The top bar and minimap always stay.

**Branding is negative space**: names, logos, scores, bans, bracket and game count are
drawn by OBS over empty regions the interface leaves (§6).

**Status, 2026-09-30: Phase 2 (building the default view) is well along.** Phases 0
(toolchain) and 1 (probing the unknowns) are done. Built, and confirmed in game unless noted:

- **Hero row** — Blizzard's *in-game* top-bar cells, slanted and interlocking, scaled
  (`[hero_row] scale`, 1.5125 since 2026-09-30 — that size not yet seen in game): portrait,
  health, resource bar in Blizzard's per-hero colours, CC text and icon, death timers
  (per-Viking ones in each third), Viking bars in thirds, Rexxar's bar full height (Misha's
  hidden), fountain-ready marker, Abathur clone marker, and Blizzard's in-game heroic panel
  (icon, frame, ready glow, cooldown count and dim; Tracer's Pulse Bomb charge instead of a
  cooldown). Clicking a plate selects the hero and locks the camera, as in the default UI.
- **Team XP** along each row's top edge and **core HP** above it, cut to the slant; hidden
  until a team's first hero loads; rows pack toward the minimap with fewer than five heroes
  (untested).
- **Top bar** — Blizzard's hexagon and clock on our generated chrome backplate (`[top_backplate]`),
  team levels, Blizzard's talent-advantage flame when a team is a tier ahead.
- **Pop-ups** on the plates — the talent just picked, and a green plus when a hero drops to
  25% (once per dip, gone after ~4 s or at death or above 30%).
- **Info panes** — talents, KDA/damage, healing, structures/XP: one at a time on
  `Ctrl+Shift+1-4`, each with an X; the leader in each column softly highlighted.
- **Inspect card** — the selected unit's portrait, name/player/level, fountain, bars, buffs,
  abilities, talents and stats; shows exactly when the default UI's small inspector would.
- **Kill feed** top-right, **minimap** bottom-centre, **replay controls** top-left with a tab
  when collapsed (replays only). Blizzard's player HUD and talent picker never show.

Not yet: map objectives (pinned to the right edge on many maps — a per-map pass), the OBS
graphics package, the fight-mode hotkey, and the visual pass that takes the chrome look of
the top bar to the plates, bars and panes. §7 has the open list.

## 2. The loop

```
python tools/pack.py --wait
```

One command: **generate → stage → validate → pack → deploy.**

1. **generate** — `tools/gen.py` rewrites the committed generated layouts from `layout.toml`
2. **stage** — `src/FCJH.StormInterface/` is copied to `build/<profile>/`. A dev build adds
   the build stamp and the wireframe overlay there, and only there
3. **validate** — `tools/validate.py` on the staged tree; an error stops the build
4. **pack** — an uncompressed MPQ v1 archive, read back and compared file by file
5. **deploy** — `Documents/Heroes of the Storm/Interfaces/FCJH.StormInterface`

**With the client left open** (all confirmed 2026-09-25):

1. Launch Heroes **from the Battle.net app**. Double-clicking a replay goes through
   `HeroesSwitcher`, which has no auth token — that is the password prompt that never remembers.
2. Open a **current-patch** replay from the in-game Replays tab (§5).
3. Edit, then `python tools/pack.py --wait`.
4. Leave the replay. The file is **locked while a replay is open** and writable at the main
   menu; `--wait` retries, so the build lands the moment you exit.
5. Reopen the replay. **The game re-reads the interface on every replay load.**

**Profiles.** Dev (the default) shows a build stamp — `FCJH DEV <version> <commit>[+] <time>`,
`+` meaning uncommitted changes — and tints every wireframe box on screen in its legend
colour (white: ours, orange: OBS space, teal: on demand), so each element can be built
against where it is meant to land. `--release` is exactly what `src/` holds: it refuses
while `src/`, `layout.toml` or `tools/` have uncommitted changes, so every release is
reproducible from its commit, and writes `dist/v<version>/FCJH.StormInterface`
(`--deploy` to also install it). GitHub releases ship that file.

### Tools

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `python tools/pack.py --wait` | The loop above |
| `python tools/gen.py [--check]` | Regenerate; `--check` fails if a generated file is stale or hand-edited |
| `python tools/validate.py [--show <frame path>]` | Validate `src/`; `--show` prints the merged tree under any frame |
| `python tools/test_validate.py` | 19 validator tests against the build 50 fixture |
| `python tools/mpq.py list\|extract <archive>` | Inspect any archive, including Ahli's and Spazzo's |
| `python tools/make_test_ui.py` | Smoke test: a magenta box as `FCJHTest.StormInterface`, to tell "packer broke" from "layout broke" |

**The validator** rebuilds the GameUI frame tree the way the game does — Blizzard's layouts
from the JamiePhan extract in DescIndex order, templates expanded, `file=` overrides applied
— and checks what our files contribute. Errors: unparseable XML (the game silently drops the
*whole* interface), undefined constants, missing templates or override targets, frame
references that resolve to nothing, malformed anchors, and edits to Blizzard children that
don't exist (the game silently creates an empty frame). Warnings: parking a frame others
anchor to, anchoring a side Blizzard re-anchors at runtime, `Visible=false` on Blizzard
frames, `Fill` without `AdjustmentColor`, partial constants, type mismatches. The Java
builder it replaced checked far less — its anchor validator was `TODO` stubs.

---

## 3. Authoring

**The user never touches XML.** Their surfaces are `layout.toml`, the wireframe canvas, and
the game. Describe effects, not diffs; verify with screenshots.

```
layout.toml                                  every placement number and look setting, in PIXELS
tools/gen.py                                 turns it into layouts and textures
tools/inspect_card.py                        the inspect card (reads hero data from JamiePhan)
src/FCJH.StormInterface/                     the archive's file tree, one to one
  Base.StormData/UI/Layout/
    DescIndex.StormLayout                    GENERATED — every layout, constants first
    FCJH_Constants.StormLayout               GENERATED — layout.toml in layout units
    FCJH_HeroRow.StormLayout                 GENERATED — cells, heroic panels, pop-ups, row packer
    FCJH_StatPanes.StormLayout               GENERATED — the three stat info panes
    FCJH_Inspect.StormLayout                 GENERATED — the inspect card
    FCJH_*.StormLayout                       hand-written, one per concern (top bar, hidden
                                             HUD, talents pane, kill feed, minimap, replay)
  _Assets/Textures/FCJH_*.dds                GENERATED — slanted bars, masks, the top backplate
src/dev/                                     dev-only probes (empty now; packed into dev builds)
```

- **Layout units are not pixels.** The game lays out on a 1200-unit-tall grid, so at 1080p
  **1 unit = 0.9 px** on both axes (the screen is 2133 × 1200 units). Build 50 proved it:
  slots set 102 units apart measured ~92 px. `layout.toml` holds pixels straight off the
  wireframe; `gen.py` converts. Never hand-convert.
- Every element becomes constants `FCJH_<NAME>_L/_T/_R/_B/_W/_H`, edges measured from the
  screen's top-left — anchor them to `$GameUI` with `pos="Min"`. Hero cells are
  `FCJH_HERO_1` … `FCJH_HERO_0`.
- **Generated files are committed** and carry a do-not-edit header; `gen.py --check` catches
  hand edits. Hand-written XML for one-off structure (it maps one to one onto Blizzard's and
  Ahli's files); Python generation for anything arithmetic or repetitive.
- **Frames we add carry the `FCJH_` prefix.** The validator relies on it: an unprefixed child
  that doesn't exist in Blizzard's tree is an error, because the game would silently create
  an empty frame. Constants are global across all files, so ours are `FCJH_` too.
- Split layouts by concern, not one file.

### Rules learned the hard way (all confirmed in game)

- **Park, don't hide.** `Visible=false` does not stick on Blizzard panels; move the frame
  off-screen, pinning all four anchors.
- **Parking a frame drags anything anchored TO it.** `HeroPortraitImage` anchors to
  `IconFrame`; parking `IconFrame` sent all ten portraits off-screen for three builds. Hide
  such frames with `Alpha 0`. (The validator now warns.)
- **Render order follows the frame TREE; `RenderPriority` only sorts siblings.** Frames added
  to `GameUI` paint above everything in `UIContainer`. To sit behind a Blizzard frame, inject
  beside it inside its own hierarchy.
- **The base UI binds no player to the hero cells** — the engine fills them by ordinal
  position. Addressing heroes by `PlayerId` is a different axis. Inherit, never rebuild (§6).
- **Blizzard StateGroups can `SetAnchor` at runtime**, overriding our anchors (e.g.
  `HeroDeathTimeLabel`). The validator warns.
- **`#Constant` substitutes only as a whole attribute value.** `Fill` reads `AdjustmentColor`
  (`A,R,G,B`), not `Color`.
- **`ObserverTopPanel` is load-bearing for the portraits** — park only its art.
- **Duplicate frame names are everywhere** (`PartyFramePanel` has its own `Team1HeroOverview`).
  Confirm ownership by displacing a frame, not by matching a name.
- **Hidden frames don't run their animations**, and a StateGroup is **not reliably
  re-evaluated when an animation flips a frame it watches**. Timers live on visible frames;
  never make a state transition *wait* on an animation-driven flag (nine heal pop-up rounds).
- **To follow a Blizzard frame's visibility, park it (+ Alpha 0), don't force it hidden** —
  a looping Visibility animation also erases the signal (the inspect card follows the default
  UI's inspector this way).
- **Restating a Blizzard StateGroup by name overrides it** (Rexxar's bar, `HeightOverride`).
- **`IgnoreParentAlpha`** lets one child draw inside a see-through parent — a way to lift one
  piece out of a panel we keep alive at Alpha 0 (Tracer's meter, the heroic's tooltip icon).
- **Property conditions take `operator=`** (`LessThan`, `NotEqual`...), but label text still
  compares as text; the heal sensor matches the health percent string by string.
- **In the observer, selection is what locks the camera to a hero.** Keep Blizzard's click
  behaviour on the plates.
- Tooltips come from Blizzard's own tooltip-bearing frames (talent icons, its own panels);
  an ability icon of ours showed none.

### Practices

- **Keep the build stamp.** A stale stamp means a cached interface; nothing else on screen is
  evidence.
- **Displace, don't guess.** After two unexplained builds, move each suspect somewhere obvious.
- **Colour a frame garishly before concluding it doesn't render.**
- **One change per build.** Stacked unverified builds produce an unattributable mess.
- **`python tools/validate.py --show <path>`** before guessing what a frame is anchored to.

## 4. Reference material

- **`references/JamiePhan/`** — shallow clone of
  [jamiephan/HeroesOfTheStorm_Gamedata](https://github.com/jamiephan/HeroesOfTheStorm_Gamedata),
  an automated extract of Heroes game data, currently **2.57.0.98304**. The validator's
  source of truth. Refresh with `git -C references/JamiePhan pull --depth 1`.
- **`references/Galaxy-Observer-UI-HeroesFix/`** — Spazzo's fork of Ahli's (retired) builder.
  Its `tools/plugins/mpq/MPQEditor.exe` is an independent check of our archives
  (`MPQEditor.exe e <mpq> * <dest> /fp`).
- **`references/AhliObs.StormInterface/`, `references/Spazzo/`** — two mature observer
  interfaces, unpacked. Ahli's is MIT. Most techniques here came from reading them.

`references/` is gitignored. Key base-UI files, under
`references/JamiePhan/mods/core.stormmod/base.stormdata/ui/layout/ui/`:

| File | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `gameui.stormlayout` | The root frame tree and most handles |
| `stormobserverpanel.stormlayout` | Observer top bar, hero cells, team containers, core HP, levels |
| `partyframe.stormlayout` | Player HUD top bar — has `TeamTalentAdvantageFrame`, the talent-lead flame (line 3268) |
| `unitstatus.stormlayout` | World nameplates, CC validators, buff/debuff element |
| `heroconsole.stormlayout` | Bottom-left portrait/stats cluster |
| `talentsoverviewpanel.stormlayout` | Talent tier grid |

## 5. Environment gotchas

**Interface selection lives in TWO files**: `Documents/Heroes of the Storm/Variables.txt` and
`.../Accounts/<id>/Variables.txt`, keys `observerinterface=` and `replayinterface=`, full
filename with extension. Edit only while Heroes is closed — it rewrites both on exit (it
blanked the top-level keys and kept the account file's on 2026-09-25). Set both.

**Out-of-patch replays wipe the selection** via a client version switch — five times so far.
Keep a current-patch replay; an AI-vs-AI custom lobby you observe produces one.

**File lock**: the selected interface is locked while a replay (presumably a match) is open.

**Resolution is locked to 1920×1080** in the top-level `Variables.txt` (backup
`Variables.txt.res-bak`). `layout.toml` assumes it.

**Screenshots** land in `Documents/Heroes of the Storm/Screenshots/` and can be read directly.
Ask for one rather than a description.

---

## 6. Design decisions worth not relitigating

**Relocate Blizzard's hero cells; don't rebuild them.** No bindable "icon for this player's
hero" exists; relocated cells bring portraits, HP, click handling and death state, and
survive new heroes. Spazzo's per-hero textures are why his files run to 13,000 lines.

**Inherit bindings; never reconstruct them.** Put new frames *inside* the frame that owns the
binding — the CC sensor lives inside each cell's `HeroStatus`, so it always matches the
portrait above it; the resource bar, heal sensor and heroic tooltip do the same.

**Use Blizzard's CC plate, not a rebuilt one.** A hand-built label rendered nothing; the
engine's element is self-managing.

**Branding is negative space**, drawn by OBS. The interface can't see OBS, so there is no
in-game fallback for missing names or logos.

**Plates are Blizzard's in-game top-bar cell, not the observer's.** Its art, sizes and
stacking are rebuilt in `tools/gen.py` (`HeroCell`) and only scaled; the portrait crop is
worked out from the cell's shape. The user wants that look (their screenshots are in `design/`).

**Fight mode = a hotkey that hides a list, not a layout.** The agreed default view already
is the old fight-mode cluster. Pooled team HP is dropped: layouts have no arithmetic, and
five segments would duplicate the hero row. If plates read too small, widen them.

---

## 7. What's next

**Waiting on an in-game check** (built 2026-09-30):
- plates at the new scale (1.5125): fit, pop-ups, bars, CC, death timers
- Tracer's charge meter and the heroic tooltip, both lifted out of the hidden talent row with
  `IgnoreParentAlpha`; that build carries a magenta test square on Tracer's heroic (it shows =
  the lift works) — remove it (`FCJH_LiftCheck`, `tools/gen.py talent_row_lifts`) afterwards
- the inspect card's X, and clicks inside it no longer closing it

**If the lift works**, it can replace some mirrors: e.g. Blizzard's own heroic cooldown sweep and
count (`UnitStatusAbil`, which already follows the moved heroic talent icon) instead of our
copied label and dim states. Only the talent row can be lifted this way — `PartyFramePanel` is
hidden outright for observers, not faded.

**Open:**
- map objectives: many are pinned to the screen's right edge (Blizzard's minimap sits there);
  a per-map pass in `MapMechanicPanel`
- the visual pass: the chrome backplate look to the plates, XP/core bars (a mid-height bevel,
  like the player view's core bar; the default UI's core bars: `design/ref_default_core_hp.png`)
  and the info panes (zebra rows, Heroes palette); fountain markers re-angled to the plate
- wireframes for the nameplates / XP / core HP
- the OBS package (names, logos, scores, bans, bracket, game count)
- fight-mode hotkey; our own hotkeys (Blizzard's 1-8 and Ctrl+1/2 are "observe player N")
- rewinding a replay upsets pop-ups and latches — final polish (the product is for live games)
- rows with fewer than five heroes (needs a 3v3 or 1v1 replay)

**Settled as impossible:** jumping to one Lost Viking from the plate (Blizzard's per-Viking
targets in its in-game bar are ping buttons with selection off).

**Phase 1 (2026-09-25), condensed** — each is now a rule in §3 or a feature above: the
0.9 px/unit calibration; the minimap as a fixed square the engine fits maps into; the
`ToggleControl` hide hotkey; resource bars bound inside `HeroStatus` and coloured from
Blizzard's own hero table; talent-lead tiers compared as one-digit labels; talent picks via
`TalentTierState="TierSelected"`, watched by full path from outside the icons; our own
`HeroTalentsPanel` instance for the talents pane (the engine fills it, tooltips and all);
validator animation elements don't run in observer cells, so the heal sensor reads Blizzard's
health percent label instead. The round-by-round notes are in git history (`a0180f9` and the
commits around it).

---

## 8. Original brief

`~/Downloads/hots-observer-interface-brief.md`, outside the repo. The operating model is a
**solo observer/commentator** who also talks: anything mid-fight is one keypress, and the
default view must look right untouched. Since tested: the top bar *can* be displaced, and
per-hero CC for non-selected heroes *is* readable.
